# StreamlineVR is designed to seamlessly play back CFD or other simulation data (X3D format) in virtual reality.

# StreamlineVR is a stand-alone, interactive, real-time, VR, 3D simulation file viewer built in Unity. It allows users to
#import all of their .X3D files representing their simulations at runtime of our application to view their entire simulation 
#play out in an uninterrupted VR experience. Useful tools are provided to the user for coloring, translating, and scaling meshes to 
#improve efficiency while studying data. Users are also able to save their work to come back to in the future, and are able to 
#send their projects to other potential collaborators.
